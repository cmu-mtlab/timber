scientists completed the study on the order of chromosomes critical to early arzhermes syndrome
-LRB- afp , paris , thursday -RRB- a group of international scientists said that they had completed the study on the order of the 14th pair of chromosomes of human beings . the pair of chromosomes are related to many diseases , including early arzhermes syndrome which can possibly contracted to people in their 30s .
they are the 4th pair of chromosomes whose order have been identified . they consist more than 8700 pairs of dnas .
the research result published on the british weekly magazine , nation and science , shows that the 14th pairs of chromosomes are formed by 1050 genes or gene fragments .
the goal of the gene scientists is , to provide diagnostic tools to find the defective genes that causes illness and ultimately find cures preventing these genes from coming into being .
international scientists led by genoscope in france said , the 14th pair of chromosomes are critical to liangcong genes of the immune system and over 60 diseased genes .
in early researches to many diseases , the 14th pairs of chromosome are quite prominent . these diseases include a kind of convulsive anesthesia during enfant period , teeth default and some eyesight and hearing damages as well as the early arzhermes syndrome .
there are 200,000 americans suffer from early arzhermes syndrome , that accounts for 5 % of the total arzhermes population .
human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
in the past 3 years , 3 pairs of chromosomes have been identified with their orders , including the 20th , 21st and 22nd .
