london 's daily express has reported that two laptop computers containing material on the probe into princess diana 's fatal car crash in paris in 1997 have been stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner .
the report says the theft has given rise to conjecture that the computers may contain confidential material from the investigation headed by former metropolitan police commissioner lord stevens .
however , a spokeswoman for the metropolitan police said the computers did not contain any sensitive information or any material linked to the probe .
lord stevens is the chief constable of northumbria police in england . his office is located in newcastle upon tyne .
the report said detectives with the northumbria police have been investigating two burglaries in the last ten days .
the first took place on the weekend of january 28 to 29 when the computers and cash were taken . the second burglary took place last week , but without any loss .
northumbria police also said there was no evidence that the two break-ins were linked to lord stevens ' work .
stevens has been investigating if the princess of wales ' death was not the result of a straightforward car accident .
